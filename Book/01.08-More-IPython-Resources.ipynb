It includes everything from short examples and tutorials to full-blown courses and books composed in the notebook format!\r\n",
    "Video Tutorials: searching the Internet, you will find many video-recorded tutorials on IPython. I'd especially recommend seeking tutorials from the PyCon, SciPy, and PyData conferenes by Fernando Perez and Brian Granger, two of the primary creators and maintainers of IPython and Jupyter."

As you go through the examples here and elsewhere, this can be used to familiarize yourself with all the tools that IPython has to offer."

    "Most of the time when a Python script fails, it will raise an Exception. When the interpreter hits one of these exceptions, information about the cause of the error can be found in the traceback, which can be accessed from within Python. With the %xmode magic function, IPython allows you to control the amount of information printed when the exception is raised. Consider the following code:"
